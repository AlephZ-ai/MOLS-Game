# MOLS-Game README

## What is a MOLS?

A Mutually Orthogonal Latin Square (MOLS) refers to an arrangement on an n-by-n board where each tile carries two distinct variables. For example, consider the suit and value of a playing card as these variables. A MOLS arrangement ensures that across any row or column, no two tiles share the same pair of variables.

## About the Game

MOLS-Game is a twist on the classic 15-puzzle, where the goal is not simply to order numbers from 1 to 15 but to achieve a MOLS configuration. This adds a twist to the traditional puzzle, challenging players to think about the game in a fundamentally new way.

## Purpose of This Code

The primary aim of this project is to explore the properties of MOLS. We are particularly focused on demonstrating that any arbitrary permutation of a 15-puzzle is "playable," meaning it can reach a valid MOLS solution within a reasonable number of moves (approximately 15-20). Additionally, we are interested in finding the  smallest distances possible between two MOLS as well as the two MOLS with the largest non-infinite distance between each other.
